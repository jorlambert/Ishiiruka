Up and down arrow in game control volume
Client side music off check box on netplay window (To make this default right click Brawl and go to properties then patches and check the music off box)
Open chat in game with T
PM runs on SI Read polling
Setting to show clock in game
PM shows frame time
Added true aspect ratio for PM (69:40)
Black frame insertion and burn in reduction (An external frame limiter is needed to make BFI work. Use your graphics card's vsync instead of dolphin's)

Discord Rich Presence
Fixed Gecko Code downloading
Changed buffer behavior so player buffers follow the minimum buffer if player buffer wasn't changed
Lowered dolphin's internal volume for the cubeb audio backend so you don't destroy your ears above 20% volume

Added netplay button to the main bar to make joining easier (Image by fudgepop01)
Now when hosting a netplay lobby the code is automatically copied to your clipboard

Disable sd card writing without affecting memory cards. Move the setting to the wii pane.
Add /dev/dolphin for homebrew to get information about Dolphin
Now only dumps textures in .png format

2.2
Netplay session replays that are saved to the WII (NOT SD CARD) will be saved in the folder named "ReplayData" 
	To view these replays use Bird's Replay Manager.exe or copy the one from the session you want and go here: 
	/User/Wii/title/00010000/52534245/data and replace collect.vff with the one you want to view (rename it to collect.vff) then launch the game offline (not in a netplay window)
Added spectator mode setting when joining a code and in the netplay window! No more asking the host to turn your port off!
Added ability to view a gamecube adapter's pollrate in the controller menu
Added WASAPI as an audio option and a cubeb update from mainline
Fixed offbrand adapters not working
Dolphin now has an updater included for easy auto updates!
